As a child, you learned the alphabet. As a first step of you teaching your computer stuff, it makes sense to make it learn the alphabet as well. Given a lowercase English letter, output the next letter in the alphabet. In case the alphabet is over, you should output the first letter of the alphabet.

## Input
A single character which is a lowercase English letter.

## Output
A single character which represents the following lowercase English letter or the first letter of the alphabet if there is no following letter.
